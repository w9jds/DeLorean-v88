  Code of Conduct
</h1>

Purpose
-------

A primary goal of [GDG Kansas City](https://gdgkc.org) is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). GDG Chicago prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means [jerky behavior](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_jerk) isn’t allowed.

This goal and policy is applied to any and all events ran by GDG Kansas City, including DevFest KC. All attendees are expected to comply in full to this policy.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in Google Developers Group to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. We also include ways for DevFest attendees to report any violations. Together we can make DevFest KC a fun harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
--------------------------------------
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

Expected Behavior
-----------------
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

- Attempt collaboration before a conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
